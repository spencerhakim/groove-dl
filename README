A downloader to Grooveshark's awesome music library. Based off the wiki at:
http://nettech.wikia.com/wiki/Grooveshark_Internal_API.

Dependencies:
		1) Python 2.6

Run `groove.py "[query]"`, where [query] is the search term(s) you would enter into Grooveshark's web interface. This script will download the first file returned in the search results and cache it into the ./cache/ directory (you must create this ahead of time). If the file you desire has already been downloaded and cached, it will not download it again. If the script is successful, it will print out the relative path of the file. If unsuccessful, nothing will be printed, and the return code will be non-zero. This was designed as a helper script for automated systems.

I'm not responsible for any violations this script does to Grooveshark's TOS. It's more of a proof of concept.
